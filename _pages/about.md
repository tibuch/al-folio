I grew up in Kreuzlingen (Switzerland) right at the border to Konstanz (Germany), where I studied Computer Science at the University of Konstanz. During this time I learned about the field of biological image analysis and joined the community united in <a href="https://forum.image.sc/">image.sc</a>. With my training in software development I was able to join the open-source developer community of <a href="https://github.com/imagej">ImageJ</a> and contribute to several tools used in bio-image analysis. 

In September 2017 I started my PhD at MPI-CBG/CSBD in Dresden in the <a href="https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research-groups/current-groups/florian-jug/research-focus/">Jug-Lab</a>. My research evolves around content-aware image restoration techniques with a focus on image denoising.
